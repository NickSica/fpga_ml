\begin{abstract}
Sleep apnea is a potentially deadly affliction causing irregular or halted breathing during periods of sleep that many individuals will unknowingly suffer from in their lifetime. It is usually diagnosed using polysomnography (PSG) testing either in a lab environment, which is costly and accurate, or in-home tests (IHT) where it is cheaper in exchange for underestimating the apnea’s severity. Machine learning has the potential to accurately predict sleep apnea severity using the same oxygen saturation levels as a PSG or IHT test. Deep learning has emerged as a vital subfield using a multi-layered architecture vaguely reminiscent of the human brain in its complexity, and it has shown to be incredibly accurate with the expense being increased power, complexity, and time requirements. The gap between PSG tests and IHTs may be reduced with a machine learning model that has the accuracy of the PSG tests and that can be implemented on the resource limited IHT kits. Bridging this gap will contribute to wider test availability while remaining economically feasible. Initially, spiking neural networks (SNN) have been observed to decrease power, computing, and time while being able to process in near real-time. Similarly, FPGAs have shown to further reduce power, computing, and time when such an SNN is programmed onto them. In addition, the FPGA’s re-programmability makes it suitable to utilize any onboard SNN model. CPUs and GPUs may be used to generate these models, while the FPGA will house them and make predictions using the trained model’s rules.

\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Motivation}
Sleep apnea is a sleeping condition which causes the airway to become blocked at various times throughout the night, which is known as obstructive sleep apnea. If the brain does not send any signals to breathe, it may be central sleep apnea. Regardless of type, it can be very deadly to suffer from sleep apnea as it lowers the oxygen levels of the body which can reduce performance in the short-term, and if left undiagnosed, contribute to a myriad of health issues such as a heart attack, diabetes, cancer as well as a shorter life span \cite{hopkins}. 
span \cite{hopkins}.
\subsection{Problem Statement}
Utilizing the data as a potential use case, the team will develop and implement a machine learning model, a spiking neural network, on a processing unit, an FPGA, to improve detection and labeling of oxygen levels and brain signals.  Since a technician must be required to view and analyze the data for sleep apnea, this model may eliminate the need for a technician until an episode has occurred or a sensor has been shifted. This frees the technician and allows them to perform other tasks unless the device notifies them, which will only occur if a sleep apnea episode has occurred or there is a need for adjustment. In the case of the sensor being shifted for both a PSG or an in-home test, someone can be notified, and a mark can be indicated for such an event and projections can be produced to reduce impact of data loss. Another contribution will be to reduce the threshold to utilize an in-home test kit as the accuracy will be boosted since extrapolations will be made when taking in data based on previous data acquired from the candidate’s preliminary analysis. Such an analysis may include feature data such as age, height, weight, and previous medical history. Utilizing the base model and tuning the meta parameters to an individual, a model can be used in addition to a CPAP machine to reduce noise pollution and energy usage. This process anticipates bridging the gap between test types using SNNs implementations on FPGAs and producing a use case to further explore the implementation potential applications.  

Present implementations utilize deep learning techniques on sleep apnea data to detect if a subject has experienced sleep apnea. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and RNNs dominate the deep learning implementation space. However, these methods do not process signals in real time and do not predict as the events are occurring. A cornerstone for our implementation is to predict in near live time before an episode occurs based on the signals being read in. One of the important features that has been leveraged previously and will be leveraged in this implementation is the oxygen saturation index (SpO2) which is a measurement of oxygen in the blood. These measurements will be taken from various points of the body \cite{mostafa2019systematic}. Previous implementations have been on CPUs and GPUs. Another cornerstone is implementing this onto an FPGA. While there have been implementations of FPGAs with sleep apnea in mind, there has been a larger focus on screening and monitoring strictly \cite{ashmouny} 

\subsection{Stakeholders needs}
Sleep apnea impacts approximately 936 million people worldwide and more that are left undiagnosed due to expensive cost for diagnosis. It is shown that sleep apnea impacts all walks of life regardless of gender, age, ethnicity, and location \cite{valentine}. There have been studies performed in various regions to understand the demographic that experiences sleep apnea. To rank countries by how the many people of the population experience sleep apnea, the apnoea-hypopnoea index (AHI) is used. The AHI is an index that essentially states how many times a subject has experienced a severe reduction in oxygen levels which is known as an apnea episode. The criterion defined for severity is as follows: minimal cases experience five or less episodes an hour, moderate cases experience between 15 and 30 episodes an hour, and severe cases experience more than 30 episodes an hour. Utilizing this knowledge, the top ten countries that have an estimated large population of people with some case of sleep apnea are the USA, France, Germany, Russia, Japan, China, Brazil, Nigeria, Pakistan, and India. China has the largest projected population with mild cases of sleep apnea coming in at 176 million. However, this may be due to the sheer size of the overall population. It is important to note that India also has a population size comparable to China but has projected numbers comparable to the USA. This demonstrates that there does not seem to be any racial bias for sleep apnea. There are significant differences in the number of men and women affected in the Americas and in European countries. These differences are negligible in Asian countries and Australia, which may indicate a bias his could indicate that there is a bias towards men in some parts of the world \cite{benjafield}.

\subsection{State of the Art}
To diagnose a potential candidate, a polysomnography (PSG) is taken which is a sleep study to observe the oxygen levels at various points in the body and brain signals. However, this method is expensive, in the US it approximately costs \$2,999, and may not create a familiar sleep environment for the candidate which may cause complications in testing that can lead to needing more sleep studies or a misdiagnosis \cite{mdsave}. Another option is to take an in-home kit; however, this option is only for candidates that may have previous familial history and show a higher proclivity for sleep apnea based on personal health history. The pricing of an in-home test can vary between \$300-\$600 before insurance and can vary between \$0-\$50 after insurance \cite{rodriguez_2016}. Both solutions are deemed viable, however, a PSG needs a technician or doctor to analyze the data in real time and to ensure that the patient has not shifted the sensors while asleep. This same problem may be created with the in-home test kit but may result in necessary repeats of the test since it cannot be corrected by an attending technician. 

\subsection{Approach}
Present implementations utilize deep learning techniques on sleep apnea data to detect if a subject has experienced sleep apnea. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Recurrent neural networks(RNNs) dominate the deep learning implementation space. However, these methods do not process signals in real time and do not predict as the events are occurring. A cornerstone for our implementation is to predict in near live time before an episode occurs based on the signals being read in. Spiking Neural Networks will be able to maximize the benefits of deep learning while minimizing power and computation time. One of the important features that has been leveraged previously and will be leveraged in this implementation is the oxygen saturation index (SpO2) which is a measurement of oxygen in the blood. These measurements will be taken from various points of the body \cite{mostafa2019systematic}. Previous implementations have been on CPUs and GPUs. Another cornerstone is implementing this onto an FPGA. While there have been implementations of FPGAs with sleep apnea in mind, there has been a larger focus on screening and monitoring strictly \cite{ashmouny}.

\subsection{Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)}
\subsubsection{Concepts}
RNN is a type of neural network that utilizes previous choices to dictate future choices. This type of model enables the usage of sequential data or time series data. Inputs and outputs are dependent of each other in this type of deep learning model. This is because the model is developed to store information from previous inputs. Versions of this model are typically used in natural language processing and speech recognition.

\subsection{Spiking Neural Network (SNN)}
\subsubsection{Concepts}
SNN is a relatively new type of neural network that works as nodes of spikes that are triggered at certain events asynchronously. This model mimics the biological neuron. This type of model gives the benefits of low power consumption and computation time because all the nodes do not have to be processed in the model. This enables for fast signal processing which is needed when making predictions in near live time.

\section{Budget Update}
The total cost of all materials consists only of the expenses incurred by the hardware design choice. The FPGA provided by Xilinx is the only part that incurs a cost because while there is a licensing fee of \$3,500 for Vivado, there is a free webpack or lab version that can be used to program the FPGA. All other technologies used are open-source or publicly licensed databases. However, the focus is shifted onto the implementation of the software leading up to integration onto an FPGA. Therefore, the budget is \$0.

\section{Project Management Update}
Project progress is conducted in a six-month time frame split up into three academic terms as shown in the gantt chart in Table~\ref{tbl:gantt}.
Dark colorings represent portions of time where the task is being worked on with shading under assignments corresponding to the participation of
the corresponding team member. The initial month of progress determines familiarity with sleep
apnea datasets and obtaining access authorization for proprietary data once familiarity is established. Following the feature selection from available data
the software golden model of the SNN is developed as well as the initial architecture layout on the FPGA. Much of the winter season is spent on configuring
the model and developing the hardware framework. Connection between the hardware and software will be facilitated with a software testbench. Following the
connection of the hardware and the software, prediction accuracy tests will be conducted to determine how, if at all, the model needs to be tuned. Concluding
progress are the final efficiency tests for the FPGA implementing the SNN following the synthesis of the hardware bitstream. The following chart showing the
time dedicated to each design goal and the relative participation of each team member to the goal is provided below.

There were delays in the implementation of the model and therefore in the integration of the FPGA. Delays were incurred from change of data type. Parsing and re-designing data pipeline, encoding data, decoding data, and transforming the models. Trial and error of fine-tuning the models through various methodologies was another source of delays.

\subsection{Success Benchmarks}
Performance metrics such as the MSE and LSM error will give accuracy results from the software and hardware implemented model. Efficiency tests run on the
hardware give a method of quantifying the total energy cost of the implementation which must remain as low as possible.
