The results of PSG should be interpreted in the context of a patient's history and medications and observation in the sleep laboratory. As new technologies evolve, it is expected that the field will evolve. Further work is needed to determine if computerized scoring, with or without human revision, may reliably replace visual scoring in normal and abnormal sleep. Improved techniques to measure and quantify sleep itself will allow for more meaningful assessment of sleep disruption that can lead to the recognition of new disorders and better predictions of the outcomes of these disorders.},

  abstract = {Sleep apnea is a sleep disorder with a high prevalence in the adult male population. Sleep apnea is regarded as an independent risk factor for cardiovascular sequelae such as ischemic heart attacks and stroke. The diagnosis of sleep apnea requires polysomnographic studies in sleep laboratories with expensive equipment and attending personnel. Sleep apnea can be treated effectively using nasal ventilation therapy (nCPAP). Early recognition and selection of patients with sleep related breathing disorders is an important task. Although it has been suggested that this can be done on the basis of the ECG, careful quantitative studies of the accuracy of such techniques are needed. An annotated database with 70 nighttime ECG recordings has been created to support such studies. The annotations were based on visual scoring of disordered breathing during sleep.},

The resource has 3 interdependent components. PhysioBank is a large and growing archive of well-characterized digital recordings of physiological signals and related data for use by the biomedical research community. It currently includes databases of multiparameter cardiopulmonary, neural, and other biomedical signals from healthy subjects and from patients with a variety of conditions with major public health implications, including life-threatening arrhythmias, congestive heart failure, sleep apnea, neurological disorders, and aging. PhysioToolkit is a library of open-source software for physiological signal processing and analysis, the detection of physiologically significant events using both classic techniques and novel methods based on statistical physics and nonlinear dynamics, the interactive display and characterization of signals, the creation of new databases, the simulation of physiological and other signals, the quantitative evaluation and comparison of analysis methods, and the analysis of nonstationary processes. PhysioNet is an on-line forum for the dissemination and exchange of recorded biomedical signals and open-source software for analyzing them. It provides facilities for the cooperative analysis of data and the evaluation of proposed new algorithms. In addition to providing free electronic access to PhysioBank data and PhysioToolkit software via the World Wide Web (http://www.physionet. org), PhysioNet offers services and training via on-line tutorials to assist users with varying levels of expertise.},

Patients with suspected OSA and excessive sleepiness (Epworth Sleepiness Scale [ESS] >10) who were referred to see a sleep physician at one of 12 sleep disorder centers in Spain were randomly allocated to sleep study testing with either type 3 home respiratory polygraphy or laboratory PSG, with assessment of patient outcomes after 6 months. [...]sleep hygiene, dietary advice, and CPAP (if patients met specific criteria) were offered as the only treatment options. [...]although the participant selection was consistent with the patient population currently recommended in practice guidelines as being suitable for home sleep apnea testing (12), patient selection and the treatment options provided were perhaps somewhat more restrictive than occurs in routine clinical practice.

However, high melting temperature type solders (i.e. lead-based alloys containing 85 % or more lead by weight) were exempted from the directive regardless of the application in which they were used. In 2011, a recast of the RoHS directive (RoHS2) was passed to set deadlines for eliminating exempt applications such as high lead (>85 % lead) alloys. These deadlines may only be extended through requests demonstrating that there are no acceptable alternatives. While there are no drop-in replacements for high lead solders, their use in a variety of applications has been eliminated and progress is being made on other application categories. As there is no proven reliable solution for some categories such as die attach and high temperature applications, it is likely that the European Union will extend the exempt for the use of high lead alloys but limit the scope of the exemption to those applications where no reliable alternative exists. Additionally, in light of the possible impending deadlines, there is an urgent need to conduct more studies to evaluate alternatives to high lead solder in different applications.},
